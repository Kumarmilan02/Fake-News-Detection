# Fake News Detection : [FactScan Live Demo](https://factscan.streamlit.app/)

## Project Description

The spread of fake news has become a significant concern in today's society, leading to misinformation and potentially harmful consequences. This project focuses on classifying news articles as either real or fake based on their content using machine learning. By accurately identifying fake news, we aim to help reduce the spread of misinformation and assist people in making more informed decisions.

This project is particularly relevant to the media industry, news outlets, and social media platforms, all of which play a crucial role in disseminating news. An effective fake news detection system can enhance content moderation efforts and minimize the distribution of misleading information.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to classify news articles as real or fake based on their textual content. We will build and train a Bidirectional Neural Network and LSTM-based deep learning model to predict the authenticity of a given news article. This model could be utilized by media companies to automate the detection of fake news, reducing the need for manual review of large volumes of content.

   - Learn the theory and intuition behind RNNs and their applications.

9. **Understanding Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**:
   - Delve into LSTMs, a special kind of RNN, and their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

10. **Training the LSTM Model**:
    - Train the LSTM model on the processed data to detect fake news.

11. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Assess and evaluate the performance of the trained model using relevant metrics.

## Conclusion

This hands-on project demonstrates the application of deep learning models, particularly LSTM networks, in addressing the pressing issue of fake news detection. The automated approach not only increases efficiency but also enhances the accuracy of identifying misleading news content. Media companies can leverage this model to safeguard their platforms from the adverse effects of misinformation.
